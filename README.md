# üåê Three.js Projects ‚Äì Next.js + Vercel Monorepo

Welcome to the **Three.js Projects** repository!  

This repository is a monorepo that contains multiple 3D experiments and learning projects built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

Whether you're just getting started with 3D on the web or diving deep into shaders and custom geometry, this repository grows as a **learning journal** and **playground** for mastering Three.js.

Each project is:

- A **standalone Next.js app**
- Uses **Three.js** for WebGL rendering
- Deployed independently via **Vercel**
- Fully open source and documented

---

Each folder contains a full Next.js app ‚Äî with its own pages, configs, and dependencies (if needed). All apps are deployed individually on Vercel.
